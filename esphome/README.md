# megadesk_companion custom component
ESPHome deprecated [custom components](https://esphome.io/guides/contributing#a-note-about-custom-components).

The YAML is now updated to use external components.

Huge thanks to [@swoboda1337](https://github.com/swoboda1337) who did most of the conversion.

PR's accepted from the community if you know how to move more of the lambda functions into the code itself.
